Action items
-> Plot the distribution of edge weights (Beasley)
-> Test the algorithm on small data (10 items) with an optimal answer
      -> high weights (min 1)
-> 3 * randomization, then get the average e. competitive ratio
-> Try smaller increments of delta

Code plans
-> Decide on a proper rel_path resolver for GraphAP

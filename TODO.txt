		--> Potentially, just treat the last entry in the data as the one to average

-> Test the algorithm on small data (10 items) with an optimal answer
      -> high weights (min 1)
-> Try smaller increments of delta


>>> REDO THE RESULTS
	-> The current results currently use the implementation with the faulty seed

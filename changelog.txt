v0.05c: Distribution checker
+ Added a jupyter program to view the distribution of the input data
	> Change the FILE constant to test different files
+ Seed is now reset for each change in delta
	> Further ensures that subsequent simulations are independent of each other

TODO updates
+ Distribution of the Beasley data set was checked
	> They are confirmed to be primarily in uniform distribution (through eyeballing)

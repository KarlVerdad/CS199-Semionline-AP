v0.02: GraphAP class
+ Created GraphAP class 
	> This class will hold the graph, and will contain functions to facilitate
	semi-online matching
	> Variables
		- n -> Dimensions of the bipartite graph
		- graph -> NetworkX graph to hold the nodes, edges, and edge weights
		- sorted_edges -> array of edge weights sorted in increasing cost
	> Functions
		- is_matched_completely() -> Checks if every node has been matched
		- generate_lookup_table() -> Creates a lookup based on delta
		- get_matching_sum() -> Gets sum of a matching on this graph

TODO Updates
+ Completed the task of fixing the delta = 1 problem
	> The error was due to Karp being attempted on an empty graph

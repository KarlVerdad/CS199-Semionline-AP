v0.07b: Handling bias
+ Modified GraphAP.py
	> Nodes in the lookup table are now chosen randomly instead of the first x nodes
+ GraphAP is now shared across seeds (in addition to being shared across delta)
	> Small speedup especially for large n
+ Added results folder for keeping track of relevant results

Results folder
+ n30_d0.1_100-800
	> simulation count = 30, delta interval = 0.1, n from 100 to 800
	> run time: ~1 hour

TODO updates
+ Finished the task of handling bias

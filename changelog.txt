v0.13b: Metric Space Revision
+ Revised the algorithm for generating a metric space dataset
	> Uses the sqrt(radius) method to get a uniformly distributed set of points in a circle
+ Created plot_distribution.py
	> Plots the distribution of input data
+ Generated a new set of metric space datasets from n=100 to n=800
	> They are all normally distributed

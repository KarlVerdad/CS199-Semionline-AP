v0.06: Results compiler
+ Added results_compiler.py
	> Reads through the preliminary_results	created by main.py
	> Takes the average of all runs and stores them in a separate file
+ Results are stored in "semionline_results.txt"
+ Modified arguments for main.py
	> [-S] - Now toggles the save functionality
	> [-s] - Sets the seed to use for randomization

TODO updates
+ Finished the 3 * randomization task
	> With results_compiler.py, it's easy to get the average Empirical C. Ratio
